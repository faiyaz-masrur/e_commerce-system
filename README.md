# About E-Commerce System
Our project is e-commerce-based. It is an online store for customers, which is essential in the Fashion Industry. In our project, we designed a user system that is divided into two parts. One is an admin panel that can control the entire website, likewise add, delete, and view categories, add products for the specific category, and modify or delete them. Also can increase the product quantity or give discount prices if required. Next, the admin can also view the orders where all the info of customers like their name, address, phone, email, and their payment method is given. Additionally, the admin can select 'Deliver' after delivering the product to update the user and also delete orders if required. Then another part is the customer who can register and log in to the page, view and search the products, and also can add the products to the cart and order them. They can choose the payment method option, which is online or cash on delivery. Also, users can contact with admin, and the admin can reply to their queries. Moreover, customers can track the delivery process as it is processed or has already been delivered. 
These are the features we added, and by this, any customer can easily reach the site and order their desired items.
